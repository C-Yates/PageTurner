                <p style="text-align: center; justify-content: right; font-size: 1.15rem;">About three things I was absolutely positive. First, Edward was a vampire. Second, there was a part of him- and I didn't know how dominant that part might be- that thirsted for my blood. And third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center; justify-content: right; font-size: 1.15rem;">When Isabella Swan moves to the gloomy town of Forks and meets the mysterious, alluring Edward Cullen, her life takes a thrilling and terrifying turn. With his porcelain kin, golden eyes, mesmerizing voice, and supernatural gifts, Edward is both irresistible and impenetrable. Up until now he has managed to keep his true identity hidden, but Bella is determined to uncover his dark secret.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center; justify-content: right; font-size: 1.15rem;">What Bella doesn't realize is that the closer she gets to him, the more she is putting herself and those around her at risk. And it might be too late to turn back...</p>
                <p style="text-align: center; justify-content: right; font-size: 1.15rem;">Deeply seductive and irresistibly compelling Twilight is an extraordinary love story that will stay with you long after you turn the final page.</p>

                <p style="text-align: center; justify-content: right; font-size: 1.15rem;">Greece in the age of heroes. Patroclus, an awkward young prince, has been exiled to the court of King Peleus and his perfect son Achilles. Despite their differences, Achilles befriends the shamed prince, and as they grow into young men skilled in the arts of war and medicine, their bond blossoms into something deeper - despite the displeasure of Achilles's mother Thetis, a cruel sea goddess. But when word comes that Helen of Sparta has been kidnapped, Achilles must go to war in distant Troy and fulfill his destiny. Torn between love and fear for his friend, Patroclus goes with him, little knowing that the years that follow will test everything they hold dear.</p>

                <p style="text-align: center; justify-content: right; font-size: 1.15rem;">In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center; justify-content: right; font-size: 1.15rem;">Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead beforeâ€”and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weight survival against humanity and life against love.</p>
